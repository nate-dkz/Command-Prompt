# Introduction
This repository is a centralised collection of Command Prompt (MS-DOS) commands that I have found to be useful. I have gathered these commands in one place as a reference point to refer back to whenever I need them. This allows me to quickly look up and use the commands that I need, rather than having to remember them all.

As I learn new commands, I will add them to this repository so that it can serve as a comprehensive reference point. This will allow me to easily refer back to all of the commands that I have found useful, and it will also allow me to build up a collection of commands that I can use to solve various problems or accomplish various tasks.

By continuously adding to this repository, I hope to create a valuable resource that I can use to streamline my work and increase my productivity.

**Note:** I use PowerShell exclusively but there have been times when PowerShell has not been available and I have had to revert to using Command Prompt, hence why I am storing this collection here as a reference point.

Feel free to browse through and use any of the commands that you find useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me.
